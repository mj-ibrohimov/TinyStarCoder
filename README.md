# TinyStarCoder Code Completion

## Overview
This project explores code completion using the **TinyStarCoder** model, leveraging its capabilities to assist with automatic code generation. The aim is to generate accurate code completions based on given prefixes and suffixes, using a dataset derived from personal projects.

## Features
- Dataset generation from Python code snippets
- Code completion using the TinyStarCoder model
- Evaluation of generated completions with metrics such as exact match and BLEU scores

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TinyStarCoder.git
cd TinyStarCoder
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TinyStarCoder.git
```
```cd TinyStarCoder
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
To run the code completion script, execute the following command:

```
python TinyStarCoder.py
```
Ensure to modify the directory_path in the script to point to your code snippets.

### Results
Generated completions and evaluation metrics are saved in the results/ directory.

### Report
For detailed insights and findings, refer to the report.md.
